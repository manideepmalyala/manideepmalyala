I'm Manideep, a developer who enjoys building with React and experimenting with code. Most of my projects live on my local machine, but I occasionally push some to GitHub for the world to see.

### What You'll Find Here
- A few React projects I've worked on
- Some side projects and experiments
- Small scripts and utilities I find useful

### What I'm Into
- Frontend development with React
- Creating small tools to automate tasks
- Exploring new libraries and frameworks

### My Development Philosophy
Keep it simple. I like clean code and practical solutions. If it's not useful, it's not worth doing.
